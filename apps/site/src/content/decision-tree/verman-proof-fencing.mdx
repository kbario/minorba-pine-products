## Verman-Proof Fencing

Verman-proof fences are ideal for reducing traffic in and out of your property.

They are a 1.8m high fence (which stops things from going over it) with a skirt on the bottom (which stops things from going under it).

There are two layers of wire used. The bottom layer, a tighter lock stopping smaller creatures coming through like rabbits, snake, etc., and the top layer, a looser lock as small creatures tipically aren't able to get up that high.

Due to the increased size of the fence, the cost per metre is much greater compared to a traditional fence, usually around $50,000 per kilometre.

A rough bill of materials to erect a verman-proof fence is:

- 3.6m posts
  - Why such long posts? The post needs to be burried quite deep to support any large forces at the top of the post from overthrowing the fence
- Snake wire
  - This is your bottom layer of fence
- Stock lock wire
  - For the upper layer of fence
- Stainer posts
  - typically have a staining box section every 500m as to fully secure and support the fence.
